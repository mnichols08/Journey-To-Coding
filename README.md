This is a journey to better my coding skills. I will be reading books like JavaScript for Kids by Kyle Morgan, the You Don't Know JavaScript Series by Kyle Simpson, Eloquent JavaScript by Marijn Haverbeke and more. I will also be completing coding challenges through W3 Schools, FreeCodeCamp, and others. This is primarily a repository made for me, but since it is public, maybe it will inspire someone else too!
