# Nature App

Better yet, anybody have any idea for starting something up on Open Source? I would love to create an app that connects people to their surrounding nature areas like hiking, camping, mountain biking, etc. Vison Statement: To connect humans with nature.

## The goal of this project is to create some type of app which can allow it's users to create the first instance of a profile for a nature spot. They can update the area with a name, description, things to do within this area, any photographs and more. The user that creates this profile should be deemed the moderator for the area and have the ability to pass out responsibilities and roles to others that also contribute to pages. We will need some guidelines and rules to keep it user friendly, but I think it will put the power in the hands of our users.
