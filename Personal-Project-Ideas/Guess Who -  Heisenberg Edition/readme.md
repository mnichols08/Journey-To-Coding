Guess Who - Heisenberg Edition
by Manthi & Mikey

Objective: Create an interactive web app which mimics a Guess Who Board Game, but featuring characters from Breaking Bad.

To do:
  Design a mockup for the box that the game might go in if it were real.
  Design 24 face cards for the board game
  Design the framework for the game to work within an HTML environment
  Primarily use CSS Grid & Flexbox Containers to create a 6 x 4 game board to fit 24 cards.
  Collect as much information about the characters as possible and store it within a Google Spreadsheet
    Organize the characters in a way that they can be filtered by hair color and style, eye color, wears glasses, etc. Use the actual game rules as a reference.
    Either export to JSON or use tabletop.js to extract the information into a readable loop
