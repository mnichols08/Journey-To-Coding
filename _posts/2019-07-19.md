I have been doing this for a rather long time. Coding and tinkering on a computer that is. Apart from coding I do enjoy the feeling of teaching somebody something and seeing it click for that person. I am currently a student at Lambda School and I am taking a few different Udemy Courses at once as well. My focus is primarily on JavaScript at the moment and I hope to master the concepts of ES6 before getting too deep into any libraries or frameworks. With that said, I have progressed to the point of taking courses on such topics as node and react. I plan to make this a bit more interactive in the future but for now I am just going to start ranting into this blog. The bottom line is that this is an outlet for me to express how I feel, so I intend to do just that throughout this blog. I must warn you that sometimes I ramble and others I bounce from one topic to another.
